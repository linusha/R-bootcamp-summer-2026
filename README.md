# Hertie School's 2026 Summer R Bootcamp

Taught by [Linus Hagemann](http://linushagemann.de) at the [Hertie School in Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in summer 2026.

Before the first day, please install `R` and `RStudio`, as well as `git`. I prepared a guide you can follow [here](IDS_Software_Setup.pdf).

## Slides

1. [Overview](01-overview/bootcamp-overview.html): Overview of what we will cover during the bootcamp.
2. [Git](02-git/git-intro.html): Introduces Git to get everyone to the point that they can use this repo throughout the bootcamp.
3. [Intro to R](03-R-intro/intro-to-R.html): Introduces the basics of base R (objects, vectors, functions, and dataframes).
4. [Intro to Data Visualization](04-intro-to-data-viz/intro-to-data-viz.html): Introduces the basics of data visualization with R using ggplot2.
5. [Working with Dataframes with `dplyr`](05-dplyr/working-with-dataframes-with-dplyr.html): Covers the main `dplyr` verbs (functions) such as `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, `summarize()`, and `group_by()`.
6. [Vectors and Matrices](06-vectors-matrices/vectors-and-matrices.html): Overview of vectors and matrices in R. Unused in the exercises but will be helpful for Math for Data Science.
7. [Working with Dataframes in Base R](07-dataframes-base-R/working-with-dataframes-in-base-R.html): A quick look at working with Dataframes in base R. Useful for getting a sense of what `dplyr` replaces.

### Slides from Intro to Data Science

On Saturday and Sunday I used some slides from [an older version of the Intro to Data Science course](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24/lectures).

On Saturday I used part of the [Tidyverse slides](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24/lectures/blob/main/00-tidyverse/00-tidyverse.pdf).

On Sunday I used the [version control / Git slides](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24/lectures/blob/main/02-version-control/02-version-control.pdf).

You might also look through the [command line slides](https://raw.githack.com/intro-to-data-science-24/lectures/main/13-command-line/13-command-line.pdf).

## Exercises

The prerequisites (unless stated otherwise) are the [Intro to Data Visualization](04-intro-to-data-viz/intro-to-data-viz.html) and [Working with Dataframes with `dplyr`](05-dplyr/working-with-dataframes-with-dplyr.html) slides.

- [`dplyr` and `ggplot` with NYC Flights](Exercises/nyc-flights/nyc-flights.qmd): Practice using `dplyr` and `ggplot2` with a dataset of all flights departing NYC in 2013.
- [Leader Assassination as a Natural Experiment](Exercises/leader-assassination/leader-assassination.qmd): Practice using `dplyr` and `ggplot2` to investigate the effects of leader assassinations on democracy and war.
